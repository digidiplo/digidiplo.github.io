## Black Hat Python Workthrough: Chapter 1 Failure!

So I’ve failed at filling this blog for a while, so I’m just going to talk through my insights as I go through the Black Hat Python book.

This is pretty simple stuff so far. Downloaded VirtualBox as my ‘hypervisor virtualization client’ which is a technical way of saying software that lets you run lots of operating systems on it. It also recommends I download a Windows VM, which took bloody ages being 23.7GB – my poor Macbook Pro.

I then had to figure out how to upload it to VirtualBox. ChatGPT recommended unzipping the file, which created an .ova file, then importing it. Again, unzipping took a while and failed. Awkwardly, I don’t think I have enough space on my little laptop to unzip the file – so I’ll leave that for tomorrow, when I can find my external hardrive (I know, I know…)

I attempted Kali Linux instead, a migre 3.3GB. I found [this guide](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/import-premade-virtualbox/) helpful.

Sadly, came into more trouble. Couldn’t unzip the Kali Linux file correctly, kept getting an error. So downloaded The Unarchiver in the hopes this would fix the problem. It didn’t.

My god, it’s already been an hour and I haven’t got passed the basic steps.

Will pick up again tomorrow!
